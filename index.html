However, the full potential of AI is contingent upon the design of effective Human-AI (HAI) interfaces that healthcare professionals use to interact with AI technologies.\n\nThe field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has extensively explored user interface design, providing foundational principles that emphasize user control, reduced memory load, and consistency. Adapting these principles to the complexities of AI in healthcare remains a challenge, with a distinct gap between high-level guidelines and their practical application in medical settings.\n\nThis study addresses this gap by proposing specific design patterns for HAI interfaces in healthcare. These patterns aim to convert theoretical HCI principles into practical, actionable solutions that enhance user interaction with AI systems, thereby facilitating more efficient and effective healthcare delivery.');

Generation can refer to patient demographics summarization, clinical notes (or documents) summarization, and recommended similar medical images or literature.

This is mainly because those entities often include medical images or text-based information like clinical notes. Presenting this information directly is intuitive. Additionally, one-time AI predictions in regression tasks can be typically shown as numerical values.\n\n**Table and list** refer to structured representations of data organized in rows or columns, allowing for easy inspection and comparison of information. First, AI input features, such as patient demographics, lab tests, and clinical signs, are always displayed through this method since they contain multiple items along with their corresponding values. Second, multiple classes of AI prediction and confidence can be shown in tables to help users compare different alternatives. Third, metadata can be presented through tables, similar to the input features.\n\n**Elementary visualization** refers to presenting data using simple visual methods. We defined the elementary visualization based on the summarized seven visualization types commonly found in K-12 curriculums: Bar Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Scatterplot, Histogram, and Box Plot. Specifically, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Histogram, and Scatterplot are the most widely used visualizations in the healthcare domain,\n\n**Advanced visualization** refers to several complex data visualization approaches.

Sometimes, clinicians or patients may not be familiar with specific patient data, such as risk prediction scores, so they require cohort-level statistics for reference\n\n**Superimposing prediction with confidence interval** means overlaying the predicted outcome on top of its associated confidence interval to illustrate the uncertainty in the prediction. Users often need to consider the AI’s confidence levels in these high-risk scenarios with in the healthcare domain, Considering AI confidence provides contextual information for predictions, these two information entities are usually displayed together in the same view. Given confidence intervals represent a range while predictions are single values, superimposing them is a common approach to highlight their one-to-one relationship. This prevents clinicians or patients from having to split their attention between separate views to interpret the two information entities.\n\n**Juxtaposing patient trajectory with forecasting results** refers to placing predicted future outcomes of a patient next to the historical trajectory. This approach not only helps users compare past data with future predictions but also enables them to gain a clearer understanding of the overall trends. \n\n**Juxtaposing partial dependence plots with feature statistics** means displaying partial dependence plots next to the input feature distribution. To be more specific, the visual presentations of these two information entities can be aligned based on feature values—one displaying the corresponding prediction score for that feature value, and the other showing the number of data samples associated with it. This side-by-side arrangement allows users to effectively combine the two to identify where interpretations may be unreliable due to insufficient data or whether the current data processing methods (e.g., missing data imputation) could lead to questionable model explanations.\n\n**Juxtaposing patient’s profile with reference ranges** refers to displaying an individual patient’s data and the corresponding established reference ranges side-by-side. This can enhance user performance in deriving insights across various dimensions of a feature. Therefore, clinicians or patients can quickly determine whether the value of a feature is outside the normal range without increasing their memory load.\n\n**Juxtaposing or superimposing feature values with attributions** refers to either placing the feature values side-by-side with their corresponding attributions or overlaying them. Users need to identify the most salient features with the assistance of feature attributions. This presentation method offers a convenient switch between these two information entities for clinicians or patients. Specifically, once they browse the feature attributions and identify the most important feature, they can immediately turn to view its values through spatial linking. Similarly, clinicians can leverage their expertise to first identify the most noteworthy features based on their values and then grasp the corresponding feature attributions as confirmation.');

Instead, users can access these explanations on demand, usually when their decisions differ from those of the AI. This approach recognizes that human-AI interfaces in the healthcare domain can be information-rich, which may overwhelm users. Additionally, since explanation-related information entities might be unfamiliar to clinicians or patients, it could further contribute to their sense of confusion. Therefore, some systems allow clinicians to only check the explanations on demand to ensure efficiency.\n\n**Presenting AI output only after users make initial decisions** indicates that AI predictions are not dis- played until users have made their preliminary choices. This approach helps mitigate “confirmation bias”, as it encourages users to rely on their expertise and insights before considering AI recommendations. \n\n>In the healthcare domain, where clinicians possess significant expertise regarding patient cases, this method allows them to make inde- pendent evaluations. As a result, it can foster a more objective assessment of AI output subsequently.\n\n**Presenting metadata in a popover component after clicking** indicates that additional metadata information is provided only when users actively engage by clicking on a trigger.

This pattern can be used when clinicians need to select appropriate patient cohorts to calculate feature or outcome statistics as references. Additionally, this approach enables clinicians to narrow their focus more effectively when selecting specific patients for inspection.\n\n**Associating feature attributions with corresponding patient trajectory by visual linking** refers to visually connecting a feature attribution to its corresponding patient’s trajectory such as lab tests or vital signs. This approach can effectively facilitate a “back-and-forth” analysis. Specifically, while input features and feature attributions can be grouped in one view to simplify the analysis, the input features may just represent aggregated values (such as standard deviation or average) derived from time series data (i.e., patient trajectory). However, clinicians may need to examine the original patient trajectory for different items that vary over time. In this case, the original trajectory records can be displayed in a separate view, considering the complexity of the information. Visual linking can then be used to provide a convenient way for clinicians to inspect the original patient trajectory by switching from feature attributions. Additionally, this analysis can work in reverse; for instance, users might first look at the original patient trajectory and then check the corresponding feature attributions for confirmation. Visually linking the two information entities can enhance spatial consistency, thereby reducing visual clutter.\n\n**Separating explanations into pros and cons and comparing them side-by-side** refers to presenting the supporting and opposing aspects of AI explanations in two distinct views arranged in parallel.
